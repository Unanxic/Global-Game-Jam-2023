# Global-Game-Jam-2023

Story of the game:
Once, there was a tree spirit named Yolia, living inside a forest in ruins.
Yolia had a strong desire to become the Tree of Life, for it believed 
that this was its true calling and purpose.
The Tree of Life was said to possess immense power and wisdom and it was said
that whoever collected every stolen seed could become it and become the guardian of 
the forest, the protector of all living things in it.
Yolia starts a journey throughout the forest.
Can our little tree spirit succeed its mission?
